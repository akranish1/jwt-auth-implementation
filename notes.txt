WORK FLOW:

login Page from Frontend
fill the from
handlesubmit call post method through await fetch
goes to backend /login
backend give a signed token in response
frontend stores in the local storage and Redirect to profile section

//Protected route of profile checkspoint is here
profile is a protected route. That means:
Frontend checks if there is a token (stored in state or localStorage).
If no token, it prevents the user from accessing /profile and redirects to /login.
If a token exists, the component renders, and the frontend sends the token to the backend for verification.

profile frontend send get req to backend using fetch
req include header which contains token
It extracts the token from the Authorization header.
It calls jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY)
After successful verification, backend sends back user data
Frontend Displays Profile: Profile.jsx receives the data and renders it on the page.
